          This is a practice e-commerce site I built with Ruby on Rails, VueJS,
          and Bootstrap. To answer your question, no you can't actually buy
          anything here.
        </p>

          Feel free to demo the add to cart and checkout functionality. You can
          even sign up and keep track of your order history!
